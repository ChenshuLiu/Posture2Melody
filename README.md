# Posture2Melody

## Overview

**Posture2Melody** is a project that uses a **GAN-Transformer-based architecture** to generate melodies from human postures. Inspired by the idea that body posture reflects emotional states, this project seeks to create a seamless interaction between bodily movement and music. Whether it’s through dance or everyday postures, Posture2Melody transforms these movements into melodies, potentially acting as an emotional therapy tool.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by the concept of **expansiveness of human posture** in reflecting one’s emotional state. At the same time, **music** is a well-known method to influence mental states, helping to **soothe anxieties** and promote emotional well-being. By synchronizing bodily movement and music, Posture2Melody seeks to develop a creative technique that could be used in **emotional therapy**.

## Features

- **GAN-Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers to map posture data to musical melodies.
- **Emotion-Driven Design**: Explores the connection between physical posture and emotional states, creating a dynamic link between movement and music.
- **Therapeutic Potential**: The generated melodies could be used to help regulate emotional states and reduce anxiety, serving as an intervention tool for emotional therapy.
